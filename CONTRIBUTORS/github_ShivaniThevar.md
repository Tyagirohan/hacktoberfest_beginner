Hi, I am a beginner in the coding universe from a non-coding background. I work in the field of [Wildlife Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_conservation) and the interest in coding was introduced by a software engineer friend of mine. 

I started my journey from [R software](https://www.r-project.org/) through a [course](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111/104/111104120/) to learn descriptive statistics for biologial data analyasis. Then, my interest shifted towards [Python](https://www.python.org/) and I used [online sources](https://www.learnpython.org/) to learn python. 

My friend suggested that the best way to test your skills is through applying it in competitions. So, I participated in Hacktoberfest 2020 and contributed to open source for the first time!! It was a great learning experience and I would recommend every beginner to test theor skills and meet new people through global events and festivals.

Happy coding!! :)
